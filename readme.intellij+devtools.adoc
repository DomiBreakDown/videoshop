= Spring Boot DevTools for IntelliJ IDEA Users
:experimental:

## Intro

This document explains how IntelliJ IDEA users (Community and Ultimate Edition alike) can make use of the Live Reload features that are enabled by default in all Salespoint projects.
Live Reload is made possible by https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html[Spring Boot DevTools].

In contrast to Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA has abandoned menu:File[Save], and does not build projects automatically.
This leads to the impression that Spring Boot DevTools are not working (which is *not* the case):

> As DevTools monitors classpath resources, the only way to trigger a restart is to update the classpath. The way in which you cause the classpath to be updated depends on the IDE that you are using. In Eclipse, saving a modified file causes the classpath to be updated and triggers a restart. In IntelliJ IDEA, building the project (Build -> Build Project) has the same effect.

In the following, three solutions are presented on how to fix the issue.

NOTE: Do *NOT* use the first and second solution together! ‼️


### First Solution: Enable "Automake"

This one https://stackoverflow.com/a/50198253[is actually a hack]. But once set up, it will mimic Eclipse's behavior quite well:

1. Open menu:Preferences[Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler] and check btn:[Build project automatically].
2. Open the IntelliJ registry via *Find Action* (kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + A] / kbd:[Cmd + Shift + A] on macOS) and set `compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running` to `true` to allow auto-building even when the application is running.

Now, whenever you change a source, template or property file, IntelliJ will automatically rebuild the project.
Following that, Spring Boot DevTools will pick up the changes, which can be verified by looking at the console output.


### Second Solution: Use "Update Actions" (Ultimate Edition only)

The Ultimate Edition https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/spring-boot.html#configure-application-update-policies-with-devtools[offers an *Update Application* feature for Spring Boot apps].
An already running application named `AppName` can be updated via menu:Run[Update 'AppName' application] or a keyboard shortcut (e.g., kbd:[Cmd + F10] on macOS).
However, you need to define what happens during an update (the default is to do nothing):

1. Open menu:Run[Edit Configurations...] and select the application class which you want to configure (or create a new one).
2. Select an appropriate *On 'Update' action*. I recommend to select *Update classes and resources*.

Now, whenever you change a source, template or property file, you need to use menu:Run[Update 'AppName' application] and IntelliJ will rebuild the project.
Following that, Spring Boot DevTools will pick up the changes, which can be verified by looking at the console output.


### Third Solution: Use Eclipse STS

The simplest and most straightforward way, which requires no custom configuration at all, is to use https://spring.io/tools[Eclipse STS]! 🙂
